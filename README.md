# WeMakeApp Coding Challenge

This is a Next.js application using TypeScript that scrapes data from Hacker News to demonstrate my proficiency in React and Typescript as part of the ITC internship application for WeMakeApp.

## Background

To be honest, I have more experience with Java and Spring, so I had to dedicate some time to learn NextJS, Typescript, and React for this coding challenge. While I'm not very familiar with the best practices in NextJS or React, my focus was on making the product functions correctly, so the UI may not be the most creative. Still, I hope the file structure is easy to navigate, and that the project can showcase that I can learn quickly!

## Prerequisite

These are the system requirement

```
-Node.js 18.17 or later.
-macOS, Windows (including WSL), and Linux are supported.
```
## Deployment

To run this program, open your favourite terminal then 
change directory to project, then run this code.
```
  npm run dev
```
Then you can access http://localhost:3000  
(the terminal will list the url if port number 3000 is already used)
