# WeMakeApp Coding Challenge

This is a Next.js application using TypeScript that scrapes data from Hacker News to demonstrate my proficiency in React and Typescript as part of the ITC internship application for WeMakeApp.






## Prerequisite

These are the system requirement

```
-Node.js 18.17 or later.
-macOS, Windows (including WSL), and Linux are supported.
```
## Deployment

To run this program, open your favourite terminal then 
change directory to project, then run this code.
```
  npm run dev
```
Then you can access http://localhost:3000  
(the terminal will list the url if port number 3000 is already used)
